# Notes
=======

Again, two loops one to listen for key presses, and a second to listen for updates from the server

Again, append server updates to a history of states
  (bonus, we can easily make a game replay plugin to share with friends)

Render the new server states, and that's it.  THE CLIENT IS SIMPLE
