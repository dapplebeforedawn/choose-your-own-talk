# About This Presentation
## What (the hell?) where you thinking?(!)
 - The concepts of good programming are universal, and I wanted to demonstrate how everything is interconnected.
 - There's so much richness and depth to these concepts, and I wanted to be able to go a deep or shallow as the audience could handle.
 - Slide shows are boring (rotfl, a meme!)
