# For the Audience:
===================
This is for ages 8 to 80.  No one leaves frustrated.  No one leaves bored.

# About This Talk:
==================
This talk is an experiment!

You --The Audience -- are going to be in charge of what we discuss today.  I've layed out a few topics that I know you'll get excited about.  I'll talk as I guide us through (please *DO* shoutout any questions).

It's a choose-your-own-adventure style talk, with homestuck demons, core unix topics, robots, memes and a pony

It's even got talks about talks, about talks ... all the way down.

All computer programs are variations on a theme, and once you get the key, they compose into melodies of ever increasing complexity.  So gimme the mike so I can take it away. Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage.
