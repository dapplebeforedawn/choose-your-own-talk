# About This Talk:
==================

This talk is a super-set of all talks.  It contains within it all the skills any hard-skill talk could teach, and all the love and motivation that any soft-skills talk could share.

This talk even includes talks about talks, about talks ... all the way down.

I've make a huge mistake.
